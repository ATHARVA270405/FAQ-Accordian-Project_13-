# FAQ Accordion

## Project 13 - Frontend Development Challenge

This project is part of my 60-day frontend development challenge, focusing on creating a fully functional FAQ accordion. The FAQ accordion provides a clean, interactive way for users to explore frequently asked questions. 

### Features
- Smooth accordion transitions for expanding and collapsing questions
- Responsive design that adjusts to different screen sizes
- Accessible keyboard navigation for opening/closing FAQ sections
- Clean and modern UI design

### Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structuring the FAQ content
- **CSS**: Styling the FAQ accordion and implementing transitions
- **JavaScript**: Handling the accordion functionality (toggle open/close)

### How It Works
- Clicking on a question expands the corresponding answer while collapsing any other open answer, ensuring only one question is active at a time.
- The project uses JavaScript to dynamically toggle the visibility of each answer.
